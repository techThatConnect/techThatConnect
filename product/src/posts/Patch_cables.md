title: Patch cables 
subtitle: why do we still use them?

summary: Since this is tech that connect, let's take that literally and look at a piece of technology over 100 years old that is still in use today. We often call them patch cables but they are technically 1/4" phone jacks. As the name implies they were first used in telephone switch boards to route (or "patch") phone calls.  While patented in 1901 use of this cable or one very similar can be traced back as far as 1878. In the 1950s a 3.5mm size of the same jack was created to facilitate technology getting smaller. Today 1/4" are most associated with electric guitars and 3.5mm with headphones or aux cables.

### What are they?

Since this is tech that connect, let's take that literally and look at a piece of technology over 100 years old that is still in use today. We often call them patch cables but they are technically 1/4" phone jacks. As the name implies they were first used in telephone switch boards to route (or "patch") phone calls.  While patented in 1901 use of this cable or one very similar can be traced back as far as 1878. In the 1950s a 3.5mm size of the same jack was created to facilitate technology getting smaller. Today 1/4" are most associated with electric guitars and 3.5mm with headphones or aux cables.  

### How do they work?

TS and TRS these acronyms stand for Tip Sleeve and Tip Ring Sleeve respectively. These names reference the points of contact with the conductor and represent the difference between stereo or mono output. The third point of contact in TRS cables helps make a second electric circuit which facilitates the second signal for stereo output. 
We also have TRRS for devices that need stereo output and a microphone to run from the same jack. This is achieved by adding another ring hence TRRS.
The shape of the tip is also important as the indent close to the end is used to lock the cable in place. This helps to maintain a secure connection while also being easy to remove.

### Whos idea was this?

 In February 1884, C. E. Scribner was issued US Patent 293,198 for a "jack-knife" connector; this is the origin of calling the receptacle a "jack". An improved version that resembles the modern plug was patented in the early 1900s. This patent expired by the 1920s. Since this cable was good at transmitting audio, record labels began using it in music studios, particularly when connecting many instruments to a mixer. The rise of the electric guitar broadened the market significantly. The 1/4" cable (sometimes called a patch cable due to its history in telephone switchboards) is still the standard for connecting electric guitars, basses and keyboards to amplifiers. You can find a variety of lengths of these cables at your local music store. They were also used for microphones so radio also played a big role in their popularity. Every studio and sound engineer has a number of 1/4"s on hand at all times.   

### Still in use today?

Current producers of these cables include Yorkville, link audio, kmmk solutions, klots, rean, tourtech and many others. These cables are a great example of if it ain't broke don't fix it. We have used them for over a 100 years with almost no change other than a smaller size. Everytime you hop in your car turn the radio and hear the sound of an electric guitar you can be damn sure the sound passed through one, if not many, of these cables long before it touched your ears. With them being such a standard in the audio industry this ancient piece of technology isn't going away any time soon. But why are they the standard? For sure in 2022 we have more updated technologies, capable of passing an audio signal from an instrument to a speaker, Donâ€™t we?  So are we stuck in our ways or did they just get it right the first time?
